      <span class="starter_word">CoderDojo</span> is a free coding class, held every other Saturday at the GitHub San Francisco office, for kids ages 6â€“18 years old. We teach all kinds of topics like building websites, video games, chat apps, drawing apps, and many others. Sessions last about two hours and have a short lunch break in the middle.
